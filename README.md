### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ™‚

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on prototyping out an AI-powered mental health-focused journal called LifeLine Journal. Steming from a hackathon in the summer of 23 called FALL IN, I was grouped with a team of military veterans turned developers. The theme of the hackathon was on veterans' mental health and AI, and one thing every member of our team seemed to have in common is our own mental health journey. Brandon Miller, one of our group members, had the idea to create a journal entry application that veterans could use as part of their care with the VA, where an AI could review the entry and detect suicidal idiations, among other things. It's a pretty interesting application we're still working on, and if you want to learn more about it, look for my repo on here titled LifeLine Journal.
